Sloths make moving slowly an art form, so much to the point that their tendency to laze around was the inspiration for their name.

They have an incredibly slow metabolism, taking up to 30 days just to digest a single leaf!

They move at an average speed of around 13 ft per minute (4 m), increasing that to only 15 ft (4.5 m) when theyâ€™re in danger.

Talk about slow movers!
